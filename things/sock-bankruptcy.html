                           <p>Over the past several years my sock drawer had become a stuffed archive of non-matching singles.  I dislike throwing one sock away just because its pair got a hole.  My thought was that since the socks were bought in 6 packs eventually another single in a pair would fail and then it would again have a match!</p>
<p>Its great logic, but in the long run it doesn't end up working out as I rarely buy the same 6 pack of socks again.  The net result after a few years is my stuffed drawer of singles and frequent comments from friends pointing out both the mismatches and my age.</p>
<p>So a few weeks ago, off of the usually excellent advice of my friend and co-worker Justin Davis, I committed what he called sock bankruptcy.  I'd thought about the idea before, and he'd actually gone through with it and highly recommended it.</p>
<p>The idea simply is to throw all of your socks away, and buy around $80 of new socks.  Another important aspect is that you buy those socks online and save that link for later.  I ended up going with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hanes-Mens-Pack-Cushion-Black/dp/B001OAMTQI/?keywords=black+socks&amp;qid=1368654625&amp;ref=sr_1_1&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sr=8-1">this pair of Hanes socks</a>.</p>
<p>I've been quite happy with them and it seems like this sock should continue to be produced for quite a while.  I've also been quite happy with not having to worry about pairing my socks after watching, nor walking around with mismatches.</p>
<p>Justin and I are of course not the only ones who've come up with or even named this brilliant idea.  There's already a website on it - <a href="http://sockbankruptcy.com/" title="Sock Bankruptcy">sockbackruptcy.com</a></p>
<p>Also, there's an entire service designed to keep your essentials steadily stocked.  I haven't used them but I know a few people who really like it.  If interested checkout <a href="http://www.manpacks.com/">Manpacks</a></p>                           </article>
